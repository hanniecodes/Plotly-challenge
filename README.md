There were three parts to this assignment:
- [Demographics](#Demographics)
- [Guage](#Guage)
- [Bar](#Barchart)
- [Bubble](#BubbleChart)

## Demographics
I displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object within the demographics panel. This way all of the demographics information per individual is autopopulated when the dropdown is changed.

## Guage
Utilizing the belly button washing frequency data within the metadata, I created a guage to show how many times per week each individual washes their belly button.
